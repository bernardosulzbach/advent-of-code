# Advent of Code solutions

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) events.

One of my goals is to use a different programming language each year.

## 2018

Rust.

## 2017

Kotlin.

## Using these solutions

You are free to use my solutions.

I am publishing my soluitions because people will eventually publish solutions for these problems anyway.
Also, I think that the code I write is of good quality and can help someone who is completely lost to solve a problem.

It might also be interesting to compare solutions written in different languages.
