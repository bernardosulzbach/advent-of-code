# Advent of Code solutions

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) events.

One of my goals is to use a different programming language each year.

## 2018

Using Rust.

### Challenge 5

Linked lists in Rust are a pain.

`std::collections::LinkedList` is quite poor on features.

### Challenge 9

Needed (at least I think so) a circular doubly-linked list.

Ended up allocating a chunk of memory and used indexes into it as pointers.

## 2017

Using Kotlin.

## 2016

Using Python.

## Using these solutions

You are free to use my solutions.

I am publishing my solutions because people will eventually publish solutions for these problems anyway.

Also, I think that the code I write is of good quality and can help someone who is completely lost to solve a problem.

It might also be interesting to compare solutions written in different languages.
